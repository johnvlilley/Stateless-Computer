I did something kind of interesting afterward figuring out the word problem and then someone answering it. The applicationÂ took nothing into account as something you have to count; like with the ancient Chinese Pascal's Triangle question: the old how many combinations of hats you can have on pegs, but where they didn't count empty pegs as something to count as part of the combination, I had to. Nothing has value. You learn that when most of your learning has been in 0 and 1.

The answer used Pascal's Triangle in a way nobody else has though of in however thousands of years its been around Here is an answer on Math Help Forum (there is a link to that Yahoo link I posted above here and it is discussed):

My system performs the permutations only using one command without numeric variables and without logic operators. This is niether digital nor analog logic. This is pure connectionism. Perhaps there is a way to combine this with conventional connectionism. Currently it is only 4 wheels and 4 numbers that you can hit any of the 209 unique possible combinations in 4 keystrokes or less. If I had 18 wheels and 18 numbers (base 18) there would be 2,968,971,264,021,448,999 possible combinations, each reachable within 18 or less key strokes.

I have done all kinds of things with this, if-then, do-while, a randomizer and a relational database among other things.
