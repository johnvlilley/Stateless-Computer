# Dynamic Stateless Computer
I did something kind of interesting afterward figuring out the word problem and then someone answering it. The applicationÂ took nothing into account as something you have to count; like with the ancient Chinese Pascal's Triangle question: the old how many combinations of hats you can have on pegs, but where they didn't count empty pegs as something to count as part of the combination, I had to. Nothing has value. You learn that when most of your learning has been in 0 and 1.

The answer used Pascal's Triangle in a way nobody else has though of in however thousands of years its been around. Here are answers on Math Help Forum:

My system performs the permutations only using one command without numeric variables and without logic operators. This is niether digital nor analog logic. This is pure connectionism. Perhaps there is a way to combine this with conventional connectionism. Currently it is only 4 wheels and 4 numbers that you can hit any of the 209 unique possible combinations in 4 keystrokes or less. If I had 18 wheels and 18 numbers (base 18) there would be 2,968,971,264,021,448,999 possible combinations, each reachable within 18 or less key strokes.

I have come up with what I believe is a new type of logic, it is mechanical in nature, but because I could maybe see it done on the quantum level it could be far more complex than any mechanical machine has ever been, in ways not seen in physical mechanical devices. I believe this to be a Turing complete, but more simple computer.

This logic is pure connectionism, only using connections and nothing else. I look at it as a geometry of logic. My system performs the logic only using one command without numeric variables, without logic operators, and without measurements. This is neither digital nor analog logic. 

This is not theory, I have built a working model using this logic that demonstrates if-then, do-while, a randomizer, a relational database and other logic, including a rudimentary calculator that adds/subtracts/multiplies/divides. In the working model I only use one command for hooking in the input, a few commands for output, but all the logic in between is one command that does nothing but link commands together.

The working model here I call a Dynamic Stateless Computer, in that the commands change function during the interpreting of the code and the history of the model is not reversible or memorized.

Note: after 18 years of having the Slapaho script, I made the calculators and someone close to me finally made the accusation: "You're not doing math! You're emulating math!", which is my whole point.

Look at the calculator_simple.cfg first to get an idea of what this is doing.
