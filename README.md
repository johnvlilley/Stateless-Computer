I did something kind of interesting afterward figuring out the word problem and then someone answering it. The applicationÂ took nothing into account as something you have to count; like with the ancient Chinese Pascal's Triangle question: the old how many combinations of hats you can have on pegs, where they didn't count empty pegs as something to count, I had to. Nothing has a value. You learn that when most of your learning has been in 0 and 1.      The answer used Pascal's Triangle in a way nobody else has though of in however thousands of years its been around (see link for the question and answers). My system performs the permutations only using one command without numeric variables and without logic operators. This is not digital or analog logic. This is pure connectionism. Perhaps there is a way to combine this with conventional connectionism. Currently it is only 4 wheels and 4 numbers that you can hit any of the 209 unique possible combinations in 4 keystrokes or less. If I had 18 wheels and 18 numbers (base 18) there would be 2,968,971,264,021,448,999 or almost 3x10 to the 18th possible combinations, each reachable within 18 or less key strokes.   I have done all kinds of things with this, if-then, do-while, a randomizer and a relational database among other things.
